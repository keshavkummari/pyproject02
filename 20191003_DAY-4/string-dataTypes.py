# Strings

'''
Note:
A string is an immutable sequence of characters. 

Many characters are familiar from what you can type on a keyboard â€”
a letter, a number, a symbol, or a space. 

The string with zero characters is called the empty string.

Example: 
a_str = "Python 007 @ World"

a_str = 'Python 007 @ World'
'''
#a_str = """Python 007 @ World"""

# a_str = '''Python 007 @ World'''
